## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During this project, I learned how to properly use CSS Grid to make columns responsive without the use of media query, though I did use it for other things. I also learned how to use calc() efficiently for sizing elements. Another thing I learned was how to manipulate an SVG's width and height by removing the "width" and "height" properties from their code and replacing them with a "viewbox element instead. Finally, a learned how to use custom variables and :root as a means of optomizing my workflow.

### Continued development

I am still not completely comfortable with using calc(), as the use cases I saw for it were a bit confusing. I plan to learn more about it so that I can implement it in the most useful way.

### Useful resources

- [Video explaing calc()](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7EWFoRzAkk) - This helped me und4erstand the calc forumla and how to use it in its simplest form.
